Clustering and Unsupervised Learning
==============================

Datasets and example code for Lesson 3 in Oracle Academy's Data Science Bootcamp.  Raw data for the Hadoop-based canopy clustering is in **cluster_sample.xml**.  Raw data for clustering in R is in **cluster_set_clean.dat**.  Commands for the Hadoop and Hive clustering example are in **canopy_commands.txt**.  Commands for the R clustering example are in **clustering.R**.

For this lesson:

1. Copy **cluster_sample.xml** into HDFS
2. Follow the steps in **canopy_commands.txt**
* Create a dataset for canopy clustering
* Create a dataset for k-means clustering in R
3. Compile and run the canopy clusterer
4. Load the R dataset into R and experiment with clustering in R
